    <h1>Docker with gpu access for robotics</h1>
<p>07 Aug 2024 - Mohammad Javad Zallaghi</p>

<p>#Roboticists would like to create robots, simulate them, develop their software, then deploy on the hardware.</p>

<p>In hashtag#ROS 2 ecosystem, for simulation, we use hashtag#Gazebo. But you may ask, how to model the robot and import it in Gazebo?</p>

<p>üê¢ For modelling the robot, we use URDF format. It‚Äôs kind of xml file that describe the links, joints, geometry, and collision elements of the robot.</p>

<p>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Should you create the URDF manually? Definitely no ‚Äî doing that manually is not possible. So, what is the solution for creating URDFs and loading the robot in Gazebo? I have the answer if you are intersted in using CAD for creating your robot simulation.</p>

<p>üå± I‚Äôve done it, you can see the images from CAD, to ROS 2 package, and finally the Gazebo simulation (see the attached images). This is my instruction for creating the URDF and Gazebo simulation for your robot:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CAD:</li>
</ol>

<p>1.1: Model the parts of your robot using FreeCAD software and its part design workbench.</p>

<p>1.2: Define proper LCS (local coordinate frame) on each part where the joint will be defined later.</p>

<ol>
  <li>URDF and ROS2:</li>
</ol>

<p>2.1: Install FreeCAD.CROSS workbench inside FreeCAD. It‚Äôs a tool for easy URDF generation from your robot.</p>

<p>2.2: Define the links using CROSS. Add created parts of your robot to the links.</p>

<p>2.3: Define the joints using CROSS. Define parent and child links, and the position of the joint.</p>

<p>2.4: Define the robot material in created robot object from CROSS and use the CROSS tool for mass and inertial property calculator of the link.</p>

<p>2.5: Export ROS 2 package of your robot modelled using FreeCAD and CROSS. It will create the URDF, mesh files, and Gazebo and hashtag#Rviz launch files for your robot.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulation:</li>
</ol>

<p>3.1: Move the generated ROS 2 package to your ROS2 work space.</p>

<p>3.2: Build the package using colcon build.</p>

<p>3.3: Launch the Gazebo launch file of the package.</p>

<p>3.4: Enjoy your simulation and echo state of the joints of the robot using ros2 topic echo /joint_states</p>

<p>‚úÖ If you are interested to learn this by a YouTube video, give me a comment to create it for you. üòä</p>
